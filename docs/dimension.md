<h2> Popup Dimension </h2>
<p>Dimension styles in simple popup block offers varities of styling options for defining Popup Height, Popup Width, Popup Border, and many other features that will be available in upcoming versions.
</p>
<p>For Now three different Dimensions Options are added in this release.</p>
<ul>
   <li> Width </li>
   <li> Height </li>
   <li> Border </li>
</ul>
<h3>Width</h3>
<p> The overall width of the Popup will be determined by width. The default setting for the width is 50%. Also, various width units like em, rem, px, % etc. can be specified appropriately.</p>
<h3>Height</h3>
<p> The overall height of the Popup will be determined by Height. The maximum height of the popup is set to 
80% of the actual screen height from CSS. This cannot be changed since setting the popup height to 100% would be silly because it occupies up the entire height of the display. 
The default setting for the height is 80vh. Also, various height units like vh, px, % etc. can be specified appropriately.</p>
<h3>Border</h3>
<p>Simple popup block's Border Options enable you set the popup's borders. The border can be expanded in four extra directions. Top, bottom, left, and right. Individual border width and color can be selected.  The units used to specify border width include px, %, em, rem, etc.</p>
