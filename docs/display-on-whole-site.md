By default, the popup is displayed only on the page/post where the popup block is used.

There could be instances when you want the popup to be displayed in the whole site. To achieve that, you would have to
insert the popup block in the `Header` or `Footer` templates since these templates are loaded in all the pages.

To add the poup block to either `Header` or `Footer` template, follow the steps below:

1. Go to <b>Appearance > Editor</b>
2. Click on <b>Patterns</b> on left hand navigation panel.
3. Inside **Patterns** tab you will see <b>Header</b> and <b>Footer</b> under Template Parts.
4. Click on either **Header** or **Footer** to edit.
5. Insert our **Simple Popup Block**
