You may want to show the Popup only to your specific user groups since it may not be relevant to your other group of 
users. For example, you want to show a specific popup only for your logged-in user and not the logged-out users or want to
show specific offers to your subscribers only but not to the shop-owner.

In such conditions, the block provides you option to configure the conditions as specified below.
