The timing for when a Popup shows up on a webpage can be significant. It's a matter of preference. Some might want the popup to greet visitors as soon as they arrive, catching their attention before they even look at or engage with the page's content. On different occasions, you might prefer to give visitors some time to explore the page's content before the popup makes its entrance. Or, perhaps, you'd like the popup to only appear when users actively click on something.

You have the option to choose one of the triggers available and set it up according to your preference as outlined below.
## Time
